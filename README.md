# location_widget
HTML/CSS code to be added to a Wordpress widget to provide 3 Google Maps locations

Wordpress Locations Widget

HTML & CSS code that will provide Google Maps Locations panels and can be inserted in a website with a Text Widget.  
Useful for service based industries (law firms, doctors, stylists, etc) who want to provide an attractive map for multiple physical locations.

Installation

Insert the HTML into any Wordpress text widget.  Add the CSS to the "EXTRA CSS" section of your theme or directly to the stylesheet.css if you're using a custom theme.

Usage

The HTML has been commented to explain where to insert the specific information necessary.  Ultimately, I will make this into a proper plugin,
but for the time-being, all information changes will need to be made manually to the HTML.
